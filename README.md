## DNSC 6290 - Data Science for Sports
This repo houses the main lecture code and data used throughout the course. There are four groups of material. 
  1. Warm Up

     This first part of the course is a refresher of statistical thinking, hypothesis testing, and linear regression. It does so through introductory examples with sports data. The two main statistical concepts are the Wald-Wolfowitz Runs test (ex. LeBron James free throw data) and linear regression (four factors model). It also serves to introduce critical concepts in predictive modeling (e.g., error analysis, model evaluation, data leakage).
  2. Team Evaluation

     This section introduces the ideas of Bradley-Terry (paired comparison) model for simple regression-based team rating systems as well as Elo ratings. At the same time, we discuss probabilistic and classification model evaluation. 
  3. Sports Betting

     This section caps off team evaluation with an introduction to sports betting (though strongly cautioned against) with an emphasis on moneyline and point spread bets. We also discuss arbitrage and using the Kelly Criterion for bet sizing. 
  4. Player Evaluation

     There is usually little time for this section of the course, so it's more of a survey to show students a sample of player evaluation problems that are out there. The focus is on basketball, but other sports are discussed as well.
